    <center><h1><b>METHODS OF INSURANCE</b></h1></center>
    <P>
        According to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Co-insurance: risks shared between insurers (sometimes referred to as "Retention")</li>
            <li>Dual insurance: having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk (both the individual policies would not pay separately, under a concept named contribution, they would contribute together to make up the policyholder's losses. However, in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance, dual payment is allowed)</li>
            <li>Self-insurance: situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselves</li>
            <li>Reinsurance: situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer, called the reinsurer</li>
        </ol>
    </P>
