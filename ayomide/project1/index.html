   <center><h1><b>INSURANCE</b></h1></center> 
    <p><b>Insurance</b> is a means of protection from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, a party agrees to compensate another party in the event of a certain loss, damage, or injury. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to protect against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.</p>
