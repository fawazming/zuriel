    <center><h1>CASUALITY INSURANCE</h1></center>
    <P>Casualty insurance insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property. It is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified, such as auto, workers compensation, and some liability insurances.</P>
    <ul>
        <li>Crime insurance is a form of casualty insurance that covers the policyholder against losses arising from the criminal acts of third parties. For example, a company can obtain crime insurance to cover losses arising from theft or embezzlement.</li>
        <li>Terrorism insurance provides protection against any loss or damage caused by terrorist activities. In the United States in the wake of 9/11, the <abbr title="Terrorism Risk Insurance Act 2002">TRIA</abbr> set up a federal program providing a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program was extended until the end of 2014 by the <abbr title="Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act 2007.">TRIPRA </abbr></li>
        <li>Kidnap and ransom insurance is designed to protect individuals and corporations operating in high-risk areas around the world against the perils of kidnap, extortion, wrongful detention and hijacking.</li>
        <li>Political risk insurance is a form of casualty insurance that can be taken out by businesses with operations in countries in which there is a risk that revolution or other political conditions could result in a loss.</li>
    </ul>
